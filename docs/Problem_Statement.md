Problem Statement — SmileBot (Dental Clinic Chatbot)

I. Background

The dental clinic currently handles all customer communication through walk-ins and phone calls managed by a single receptionist. This often leads to long waiting times, missed calls, and inconsistent responses to frequently asked questions. To improve patient experience and reduce manual workload, the clinic is exploring the use of an AI-powered chatbot (“SmileBot”) to assist with basic queries and appointment handling.

II. The Problem

Patients frequently contact the clinic for common queries such as clinic timings, available services, pricing, and appointment scheduling or rescheduling.Due to high call volume and limited staff, the receptionist is unable to answer every call immediately. This results in:
 * Missed appointment opportunities
 * Delays in providing important information
 * Repetitive manual work
 * Poor customer experience
 * Increased workload for staff

III. Business Impact:-

  The current system leads to:
   * Reduced patient satisfaction
   * Loss of potential clients due to unanswered calls
   * Inefficiency in handling repetitive inquiries
   * Overdependence on receptionist availability
   * Lower operational productivity

IV. Project Goal / Objective:
   
  To design and implement an AI-powered chatbot that:
   * Answers frequently asked questions (services, timings, clinic hours, dental care)
   * Helps patients book, cancel, or reschedule appointments
   * Collects basic patient information
   * Provides instant responses 24/7
   * Reduces receptionist workload
   * Enhances patient experience and engagement

V. Scope of the Project:

   In Scope
    * Chatbot interaction flow for FAQs
    * Appointment creation flow
    * Appointment cancellation flow
    * Appointment rescheduling flow
    * Capturing patient details (name, phone number, appointment ID)
    * Providing dental care suggestions
    * Simple text-based interface
    * Integration with existing appointment process (manual backend by receptionist)

   Out of Scope
    * Automated payment integration
    * Full patient record management
    * Clinic inventory or billing systems
    * Deep medical diagnosis
    * Complex triage or emergency assistance

VI. Assumptions

  The clinic continues to be a walk-in + phone-based system.
   * Appointments booked via chatbot will be manually confirmed by the receptionist.
   * The chatbot will not replace the receptionist but will support them.
   * Users have basic internet and smartphone access.

VII. Constraints

   * Budget limitations for advanced AI integrations
   * Receptionist availability for backend confirmation
   * Limited technical infrastructure at the clinic
   * Chatbot must stay within privacy & data handling guidelines
