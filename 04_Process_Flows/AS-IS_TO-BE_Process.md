AS-IS Process (Current State)

This is how the dental clinic works before SmileBot.

Patient → Walk-in / Phone Call → Receptionist
Receptionist → Check Appointment Register
Receptionist → Confirm Availability
Receptionist → Record Appointment Details (Name, Phone, Time, Service)
Receptionist → Repeat for every call/walk-in
Pain Points:
- Long waiting times
- Manual errors
- Repetitive work
- Missed calls = lost appointments


TO-BE Process (With SmileBot)

This is how the workflow will look after implementing the chatbot.

Patient → Chatbot
Chatbot → Ask: Book / Cancel / Reschedule / FAQs / Dental Tips
If Book:
    → Collect Name, Phone, Date/Time, Service
    → Check availability
    → Confirm Appointment & Generate Appointment ID
If Cancel/Reschedule:
    → Ask Appointment ID + Phone Number
    → Verify Identity
    → Update or Cancel Appointment
If FAQs:
    → Return pre-defined answers
All interactions logged for audit
Receptionist → Only manages complex cases / backend confirmation
Benefits:
- 24/7 availability
- Reduced receptionist workload
- Fewer errors
- Faster response times
